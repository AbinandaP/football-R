# football-R
Football players dataset is made with the player attributes such as Kicking score, FreeKicks etc,., and stored in SQLite database. An interactive webpage in RShiny to insert, delete, update and view the records of the database is made along with a page for finding similar players by the K-nearst neighbour model and comparison between two players.
